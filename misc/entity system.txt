Entity: //the basic unit that is being stored in the primary container
	enum Type type //this mimics the NetworkPacket pattern a bit, I wonder if it's a good idea or not
	position //will always need to know it's location, because of the big maps
	motion //probably not necessary for anything other than the players. Still might as well include it, since I'm using pretty much everything else
	box //bounding box, because of reasons?
	id //the unique entity ID. can be used to lookup an instance in a different container

entities include:

* Players
* Combat portals
* item drops? I don't know if these are visible in the world
* chests
* dungeon doors?
