* I need to keep the documentation up to date. Namely, the GDD is getting out of date.
* How many lookups is the map system using?
* Add the serial packet to the network utility

--Naming conventions--

I need to define the differences between several different terms i.e. naming conventions.
I may also need to rewrite some variable names.

* User: This is the individual who is playing the game
* Player: A synonym for a user
* Character: This is the actual player character in the game
* Username: This is the name of the player; ususally kept private
* Handle: This is the name of a character
* Avatar: This is the name of the sprite used by a character

--ServerApplication's methods--

//NOTE: I honestly don't know what I'm doing
CreateCombatInstance(roomIndex)
PushCharacterToCombat(charIndex, combatIndex)
UpdateCombatInstances() //handles all combat

--Battle System--

CharacterData:
	--stats

EnemyData
	--stats

CombatInstance
	list<CharacterData*>
	list<EnemyData>

Room:
	RegionPager pager
	EnemyFactory enemyFactory --this takes information on the room's data early in the room's construction
	list<CombatInstance>
