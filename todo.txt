I need to keep the documentation up to date. Namey, the GDD is getting out of date.

--Naming conventions--

I need to define the differences between several different terms i.e. naming conventions.
I may also need to rewrite some variable names.

* User: This is the individual who is playing the game
* Player: A synonym for a user
* Character: This is the actual player character in the game
* Username: This is the name of the player; ususally kept private
* Handle: This is the name of a character
* Avatar: This is the name of the sprite used by a character

--ServerApplication's methods--

These interact with the database file, making the server a persistent system.

* CreateUserAccount
* LoadUserAccount
* SaveUserAccount
* UnloadUserAccount
* DeleteUserAccount

* CreateCharacter
* LoadCharacter
* SaveCharacter
* UnloadCharacter
* DeleteCharacter

--Battle System--

CombatPortal:
	x, y
	list<Character>
	list<Monster>
