Please note that this game requires a functioning server to operate correctly.
Both a game server and game client are included in this package.

-------------------------
Instructions For Setup
-------------------------

1. To create a server, simply run server.exe
	(a public server is provided by default)
2. To join a server, your player information must be input into rsc/config.cfg
	(NOTE: This process will be streamlined later)
3. To change the config settings, open rsc/config.cfg
4. These settings must be unique for each player:

* client.username
* client.handle

5. There are currently two options for 'client.avatar':

* client.avatar = elliot2.bmp #male
* client.avatar = coa2.bmp    #female

6. When you've correctly set these values, run client.exe, and select 'Start'
	from the main menu; this displays the list of available servers.
7. Select the name of a server (default is 'Public') and select 'Join'.
8. Welcome to Tortuga, enjoy your stay.
