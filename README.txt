Please note that this game requires a functioning server to operate correctly.
Both a game server and game client are included in this package.

-------------------------
Instructions For Setup
-------------------------

1. To create a server, simply run server.exe.
2. To join that server, run client.exe with config settings not already in use.
    (Note: This process will be streamlined later).
3. To change the config settings, open rsc/config.cfg
4. These settings must be unique for each player:

* client.username
* client.handle

5. There are currently two options for 'client.avatar':

* client.avatar = elliot2.bmp #male
* client.avatar = coa2.bmp    #female

6. When you've correctly set these values (good luck), select 'Start' from the
    main menu; this displays the list of available servers.
7. Select the name of your server (default is 'local') and select 'Join'.
8. Welcome to Tortuga, enjoy your stay.
