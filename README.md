_This project is currently in it's early prototype stage. You can see other
versions in various branches, tagged as prototype-X._

Tortuga is a 2D multiplayer role playing game set in a large archipelago
occupied by warring pirate clans. The emphasis of this game is on multiplayer
cooperation, competition, and server customization. The game runs on highly
customizable server software that can support up to 150 simultaneous players or
more. The player characters are tied to the server where they are created and
are susceptible to permadeath: deletion of a character upon death.

## Libraries

* [SDL](http://www.libsdl.org/) - Simple DirectMedia Layer API
* [SDL_net](http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_net/) - SDL's networking
extension, slightly modified. This must be installed first.
* [Codebase](https://github.com/Ratstail91/Codebase) - generic reusable code
modules

## Instructions

* This project uses C++11, which is available via GNU (or MinGW) 4.7, or Visual
Studio 2012. Personally, I'm using MinGW 4.7.2.
* I'm trying to keep this as IDE agnostic as possible, so if you use an IDE,
please add it's files to .gitignore.
* You can read more details on the GitHub wiki [here](https://github.com/Ratstail91/Tortuga/wiki).
