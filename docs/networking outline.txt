Client:
	SceneManager:
		TCPSocket
	end
end

Server:
	TCPServerSocket
	SocketList --list of all client sockets if one is closed, remove it.
end

When the player enters the lobby, they can choose what server to connect to. When they connect to the server, they'll enter a sort of character creation screen. Once that is done, they will enter the game world proper.

This is controlled through the config files for now.

using ';' delimited commands, how can I get it to work?

-------------------------

UDPNetworkManager: //don't worry at this stage
	Open(port)
	Close()

	Send(ip, port)
	Receive()

	GetOutData()
	GetInData()
